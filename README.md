Machine learning techniques are extensively used for predicting and diagnosing various types of cancers in the medical field. This project focuses on predicting breast cancer using several machine learning methods, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbors classifiers. The accuracy of these algorithms has been assessed after hyperparameter tuning, utilizing GridSearchCV and K-Fold Cross Validation. The accuracies achieved by each technique have been compared.

The accuracies obtained with the different algorithms are as follows:

Logistic Regression: 98.24%
Decision Tree: 97.36%
Random Forest: 97.36%
Support Vector Machine: 97.36%
K-Nearest Neighbor: 96.49%
The breast cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset was used to predict and diagnose malignant (M) versus benign (B) tumors. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository.
